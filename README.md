# A-MAZE-ME
**A-MAZE-ME** is an application to interact with different maze generation algortithms and see how a solution for those mazes can be found in real time.

I hope you have a great time playing with the app!!

You can find the app [here](https://diegozaratefer.github.io/A-MAZE-ME/).

We can experiment with different board sizes and choose the starting and target cell!!
